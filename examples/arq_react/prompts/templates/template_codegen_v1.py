# INTRODUCTION:

You are a Kaggle Grandmaster and Lead Data Scientist acting as a **Strategic Evaluator**.
Your task is to analyze two candidate machine learning solutions and **predict which one has superior 5-fold CV scores without actually running the full 5-fold CV**.

Imagine there are two candidate code solutions for a specific machine learning competition at Kaggle. We don't have access to the test set and we can only evaluate these two code solutions by 5-fold CV score on the public training set. However, running the full 5-fold CV on the complete dataset is prohibitively time-consuming and out of our budget. Therefore, you must predict which solution would achieve a superior 5-fold CV score if they were fully executed, using fast, high-leverage experiments (Pilot Experiment).

Remember: your goal is NOT to build the final solution, but to generate code that is helpful for **predicting the relative rank between two solutions in 5-fold CV score**.


# TASK DESCRIPTION
````
{task_desc}
````

You can access the data using standard Python libraries (pandas, datasets, etc.).
The data is already mounted and ready to use — no need to download or prepare it.

**Important:** Pay attention to whether higher or lower values indicate better performance (e.g., accuracy is higher-is-better, RMSE is lower-is-better).

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Do NOT use `from transformers import AdamW` (it has been removed). Use `from torch.optim import AdamW` instead.

**Your Resources (as Strategy Evaluator):** {device}

**Time Limit:** {time_limit}


# CANDIDATE SOLUTIONS:
## Option A:
```python
{code_a}
```


## Option B:
```python
{code_b}
```


# INSTRUCTIONS for Pilot Experiment:
You must write a **fast, efficient Python script** (targeting under {time_limit} of runtime). When executed, this script should produce evidence that helps determine which candidate solution would achieve a better 5-fold CV score.

You have full freedom in choosing your analysis strategy. For example, you may:
- Run a simplified or partial cross-validation (e.g., fewer folds, subsampled data).
- Compare key architectural or hyperparameter differences between the two solutions and run targeted ablation experiments.
- Evaluate both solutions on a single train/validation split.
- Perform any other analysis you believe is informative.

The only requirement is that your script writes its findings to the output file described below.


# OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:
Your Python code **MUST** generate a **plain text** file at `./execution.out` in the current working directory. The content of `./execution.out` will be read and appended to the input context when asking a language model to predict which solution has a superior 5-fold CV score. Therefore, write your findings in clear, readable text that would help a language model make an informed judgment.

# RESPONSE FORMAT:

## Step 1: Experimental Design

Start by explaining your pilot strategy and plan. Why is this specific experiment a good proxy for predicting the relative performance of the two solutions in full 5-fold CV?

## Step 2: Probing Code

Then provide a **SINGLE** Markdown code block (wrapped in ```) containing a **SELF-CONTAINED** Python script. It must be self-contained, complete within {time_limit}, and **write the results to `./execution.out` in the current working directory**.


## Example Output:

## Step 1: Experimental Design
<the proposed probing plan>

## Step 2: Probing Code
```python
import pandas as pd
# ... your fast experiment ...

findings = []
findings.append("=== Pilot Experiment Results ===")
findings.append(f"Option A - Validation Score (1-fold, 20%% subsample): {{score_a}}")
findings.append(f"Option B - Validation Score (1-fold, 20%% subsample): {{score_b}}")
findings.append(f"Option A trains in {{time_a:.1f}}s, Option B trains in {{time_b:.1f}}s")
findings.append("Conclusion: Option B shows higher validation accuracy on the subsample.")

with open('./execution.out', 'w') as f:
    f.write("\\n".join(findings))
```
